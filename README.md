# Document Query Chat Assistant Using OpenAI

This repository contains `main.py`, a Python script that interacts with the user, taking in a search query and a chat query. It retrieves the most relevant documents from a pre-existing FAISS index (created in the previous repository), uses the contents to inform an OpenAI chat model, and then presents generated response. This application can be seen as a chat assistant capable of providing answers based on the content of a given set of documents.

## Prerequisites

Please ensure that you have installed:

- Python 3.6+
- `logging` Python library.
- `openai` Python library.
- `langchain` Python library version 0.1+. This library provides `FAISS` vector store and `OpenAIEmbeddings`.

You can install these dependencies with the following pip command:

```bash
pip install logging openai langchain
```

## Usage

To run the script, perform the following steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone <repo_url>
    ```

2. Replace `'YOUR_OPENAI_KEY'` in the script with your OpenAI key.

    ```python
    openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_KEY'
    ```

3. Replace `'INDEX_FILE_NAME'` with the name of your FAISS index file.

    ```python
     faiss_index_filename = 'INDEX_FILE_NAME'
    ```

4. Run the script.

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```  

The script presents an interface where you can input a "search query" (core concept you're interested in) and "chat query" (the question you want to ask). It retrieves related documents from your FAISS index and uses the content to provide context to the OpenAI chat model. Finally, it gives you the response generated by the model.

Enter `exit` as either the search query or chat query to stop the script.

Note: This script communicates with OpenAI's API. Hence, the contents of the documents relevant to your queries will be sent to OpenAI. Be aware of this when inputting sensitive information.

## Errors

Any errors encountered during the processing of queries will be logged, providing details on the search and chat queries that led to the issue. View these errors in your console.
